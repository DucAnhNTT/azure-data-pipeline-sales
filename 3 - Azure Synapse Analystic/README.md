### SQL Pools
When you go with Synapse Analystic, that mean you store data on the cloud, and more we compute on the cloud, so the computing is call SQL Pool:
Dedicated SQL Pool and Serverless SQL Pool in Azure Synapse Analytics:
* Dedicated SQL Pool:
Designed for high-performance data warehousing workloads.
Provides guaranteed and consistent query performance.
Suitable for large-scale data processing with predictable needs.
Allows for scaling compute resources up or down based on workload requirements.
Ideal for organizations with dedicated data warehousing tasks.
Serverless SQL Pool:

* A pay-as-you-go option for running on-demand SQL queries.
No need to provision or manage dedicated compute resources.
Best suited for ad-hoc queries, data exploration, and on-demand analytics.
Billed only for the queries you run, making it cost-effective.
Offers flexibility without infrastructure management.
Choosing between these options depends on the nature of your workload, the need for consistent performance, and cost considerations. You can also use a combination of both options to meet different analytical needs within your organization.
